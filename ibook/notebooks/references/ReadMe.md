## Notebooks

Each notebook will need a title to show up in the toc, so each notebook from now on needs a title cell. A lot of code examples are available at {cite}`github:ml-for-trading`.

As for implementing the the mechanisms in {cite}`book:233946`, it is unlikely that numbers would work as machine learning can handle all the stuff.
