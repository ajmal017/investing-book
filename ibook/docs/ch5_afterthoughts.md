# Afterthoughts

One of my early purchase as an investor has been victory square.

### Decision Making Framework
1. Never buy a stock expecting to make money
2. Does the stock have momentum
3. Is this a good time to buy this stock and why (good news not realised, or no interest)
4. Do I expect the stock to go up
5. Is this stock industry going to be useful and do well
6. Does the stock have good management.
